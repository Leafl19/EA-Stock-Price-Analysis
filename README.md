Dividend Yeild Over Time

Insights:

The yearly dividend was mainly at 0 in the earlier years, and haven't made any movement up until the 2010's. So i decided to analyze it from 2010-present day, doing more research i found out that EA current dividend policy was more defined closer to the 2010's so starting at 2010, gave a clearer picture for the analysis being done. All indicating that EA focus mored on reinvesting their earning for growth rather than retunrning large amounts of cash to stakeholders.

**Reconsider Dividend Strategy**: If EA aims to attract more dividend-focused investors, it could consider gradually increasing dividend payouts to align with its growing stock price

**Leverage Stock Splits for Accessibility**: EA could continue to use stock splits when appropriate to make shares more affordable to retail investors, without negatively affecting long-term price trends
