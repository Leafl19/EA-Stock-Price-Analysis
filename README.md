Dividend Yeild Over Time:

The yearly divident was mainly at 0 in the earlier years, and haven't really made any movement up until the 2010's so i decided to analyze it from 2010-present day. Also doing more research i found out that EA current dividend policy was more defined closer to the 2010's so starting at 2010, gave a clearer picture for the analysis being done. Also indicating that EA focus mored on reinvesting their earning for growth rather than retunrning large amounts of cash to stakeholders.
